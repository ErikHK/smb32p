	; Palette Data
	; The palette data is pretty much a direct write to the PPU palette RAM.
	; A palette is defined by an entire set of 16 colors, assigned by index.
	; Level_Tileset normally decides which palette to select, and then the
	; RAM variable PalSel_Tile_Colors selects which colors will be assigned
	; the bg (tiles), and after that PalSel_Obj_Colors select the index for
	; the sprites.  There is an override variable, Pal_Force_Set12, which
	; will select a palette set based on its value instead of Level_Tileset,
	; but it does not use the PalSel variables and instead forces the first
	; two palette sets into bg / sprite respectively (too bad, really!)

	; Refer to Map_Tile_ColorSets and Map_Object_ColorSets in PRG012 to change these selections
